# âš¡ Lightning Network Routing Demo

This project is a simple web application for demonstrating routing algorithms on the Lightning Network (LN).

It allows users to:
- Input a start node and an end node.
- Choose an optimization objective: minimize total fee, minimize hop count, or minimize total timelock.
- View the computed best route(s) based on the selected criteria.
